# graphics-scene-cosc363
This is a graphics scene I made using OpenGL 2 for an assignment for COSC363 at the University of Canterbury.

A quick video of the scene is at https://youtu.be/Wr5_eSIhgIk.

Instructions on how to navigate the scene and details of the contents can be found in `[Report.pdf](Report.pdf)`.

## How to run it

Just run `./scene`.

## Build instructions

To build it yourself, run `g++ -Wall -o scene scene.cpp -lm -lGL -lGLU -lglut`.

You can then run `./scene`.
